## Overview

In this project, I focused on addressing the challenges associated with Embedded C and Linux development. The goal was to create optimized, scalable, and efficient solutions for real-time embedded systems by leveraging advanced coding techniques, hardware-software integration, and Linux kernel customizations. This project aimed to improve system performance, ensure reliable communication between hardware components, and streamline embedded software development.
## Key Features

- **Timer-Driven LED Control**:Implemented LED blinking using hardware timers and interrupts to ensure precise timing and low CPU overhead.

- **UART Communication**: Developed robust serial communication between embedded devices and host systems, handling baud rate synchronization and error detection.
- **I2C Sensor Interfacing**: Established reliable communication with sensors using the I2C protocol, including initialization, data acquisition, and error handling.
- **SPI EEPROM Integration**: Implemented SPI-based read and write operations to store persistent data in EEPROM efficiently.
- **RTOS Task Scheduling**:  Designed real-time task scheduling mechanisms to manage concurrent processes efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
- **Linux Device Driver Development**: Built custom Linux device drivers to facilitate interaction between user-space applications and hardware peripherals.
- **Boot Time Optimization**:  Reduced Linux boot time by eliminating unnecessary services and optimizing kernel configurations for embedded applications.
- **Low-Power Mode Implementation**: Utilized power management techniques to extend battery life in embedded devices by dynamically adjusting clock speeds and enabling sleep modes.
- **Finite State Machine (FSM) for Control Systems**: Designed FSMs for efficient state transitions and predictable behavior in real-time applications.
- **ADC Measurement Optimization**: Improved analog-to-digital conversion accuracy by implementing filtering techniques and calibration routines.
## Technologies Used

- **Embedded C**:  For writing efficient and low-level firmware for microcontrollers.
- **Linux Kernel Development**: For customizing and optimizing the Linux kernel to suit embedded applications.
- **RTOS (FreeRTOS)**: For real-time task scheduling and resource management.
- **I2C, SPI, and UART Protocols**: For communication between microcontrollers and peripheral devices.
- **GitHub Actions**: : For automating code testing and deployment in embedded environments.

## Challenges and Learnings

   One of the primary challenges was ensuring real-time performance and deterministic behavior in embedded applications. Optimizing resource allocation and managing interrupt latencies were critical to achieving efficiency. Additionally, Linux kernel modifications required in-depth debugging to maintain stability while introducing custom functionalities. Synchronizing embedded software with hardware peripherals demanded a thorough understanding of communication protocols and error-handling mechanisms.

## Outcome
  This project significantly improved embedded system performance, reducing processing overhead and enhancing real-time responsiveness. The optimizations in boot time and power management contributed to better efficiency, while the structured FSM approach improved system predictability. By tackling these Embedded C and Linux challenges, the project provided a robust foundation for developing scalable, reliable, and high-performance embedded applications.
